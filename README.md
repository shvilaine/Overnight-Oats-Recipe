# Overnight-Oats-Recipe

This is a recipe for overnight oats - simple and delicious!

The most simple way to make overnight oats is to mix one volume of oats with one volume of dairy (milk, yoghurt or a vegetal replacement).
You can add chia seeds if you want, but always keep the same cereal to liquid ratio.
Add sugar or an alternative (honey, stevia, maple syrup...)

Keep your mix in the fridge overnight. In the morning, add any topping you want (fruits, jam, chocolate chips...) and enjoy!
